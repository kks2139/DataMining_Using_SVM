# DataMining_Using_SVM
There are five files(HKIB-20000_001.txt ~ HKIB-2000_005.txt) which have lots of various articles and the number of articles that each file has
is approximately 4000. Among the five files, file#1~4 are used to make a train file for training of SVM. And after test file is made using the file#5, test how the SVM predicts articlesâ€™ categories of test file after trained by train file. Increasing its hit rate is a goal of this project.
